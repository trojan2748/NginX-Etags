Static Etag's for NginX
-----------------------

The Static Etags module in the 3rdPartyModules page is broke:
-- malloc() called without a free()
-- Doesn't follow RFC2616
-- uses mtime, which might not match when multiple backend are used
-- Doesn't check inbound headers to see if a 304 is nescessary

This module does the following:
-- Can using any combination of Size, MTime, MD5, INode
-- Check's inbound headers for 'If-None-Match', issues 304 is needed


Usage:

Example 1:
location /img {
  FileETag Size MD5 MTime INode;
}

Example 2:
location /static {
  FileETag Size MD5;
}


** Notes
-- MTime can differ from one backend server to the next, do not use MTime on 
   backend servers if you are loadbalancing.
